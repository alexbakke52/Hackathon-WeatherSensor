# Hackathon-WeatherSensor
Portable weather hyperlocal weather sensor that will ping (send a notification to) your phone given certain weather changes.
For instance if it's about to rain, air quality has lowered, change in humidity etc.

Several possible applications:
*IoT/Smart Home - You're drying your clothes on a drying rack outside, but it's started to rain and now your clothes are wet. Avoid this issue by having a device that detects the rain
                - It's about to rain and you have windows open
*Portable weather warner - You're on a trip and dressed for sunny weather, suddenly it starts to rain, and you had no idea. Now you'll get a notification beforehand, and be prepared
